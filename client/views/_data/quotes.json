    "quote" : "This app has worked very well for me for about a year and a half now. It enables me to keep track of all my walks, the distances that I walk, and all pertinent to statistics, particularly variances in pace, and elevation changes. I have used Google maps distance measuring to verify distances and MapMyWalk is quite accurate."
